# 360_BROWSING

Please note that this Unity project can only be opened in Unity 2018.1, since due to budget constraints I had to work with several wonky asset packages that are not supported by the newer versions of Unity.

Also note that this repository does not contain the necessary videos to run the program since they are too large to upload to GitHub.
The Unity project still works and you can look at the game objects and scripts, but the videos will not be there when you press the Play button. If you would like to download the full source code with the videos, please click here:

Please visit this link to understand the context of this Unity project and how it was used for my master thesis research:

All the relevant scripts are found on the Player game object and its child objects, but the most important ones are on the BigThumb object (which is also a child object of Player). ThumbnailScript is the main script controlling everything.
